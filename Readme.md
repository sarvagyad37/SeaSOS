### Libreries Used
The code snippet uses the following libraries:

fastapi: This library is used to create web APIs with Python. It provides a fast and asynchronous framework for building APIs.

fastapi.background: This module is used to handle background tasks in FastAPI. It allows you to run tasks asynchronously in the background while responding to the client.

fastapi.middleware.cors: This module is used to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in FastAPI. It allows the API to be accessed from different domains.

redis_om: This library is used to interact with Redis, an in-memory data structure store. It provides a convenient way to connect to Redis and perform operations on Redis data structures.

starlette.requests: This module is used to handle HTTP requests in FastAPI. It provides a Request class that represents an incoming HTTP request.

requests: This library is used to send HTTP requests to external APIs. It is used in the code to make a GET request to another API.

These libraries are imported at the beginning of the code snippet and are used throughout the code to build the API, handle background tasks, interact with Redis, handle HTTP requests, and make external API calls.
